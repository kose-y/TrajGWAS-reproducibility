## Scripts for UK Biobank experiments

- Launch julia with `--project=<path-to-this directory>` or activate the environment with `using Pkg; Pkg.activate(normpath("/path/to/this/directory"))`.
- Then run `using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()`. 

Note: The package was named `vGWAS` at the time of experiments. The code has been updated to work with `TrajGWAS` v0.1.2.
